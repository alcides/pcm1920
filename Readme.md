Cluster and Multicore Programming
=================================

Objectives:
-----------

By the end of the course, students should be able to write and interpret parallel and concurrent programs that target multicore, GPU and distributed environments.


Syllabus
--------

- Embarrassingly parallel programming
- Parallel Divide-and-Conquer programming
- Synchronization primitives for concurrent programming
- Dynamic mechanisms for irregular parallelism (workstealing and granularity control)
- Parallel programming with IO
- GPU programming
- Distributed Memory Programming
- The Actor model
- The Map-Reduce model
- Concurrent program debugging
- Verification of concurrent programs

Requirements
------------

Programming in C, Java or a similar language. It is expected some knowledge of Functional Programming (Haskell, Python).


Expected amount of work
-----------------------

- 6 ECTS credits
- 39 hours of classroom
- 129 hours of autonomous work


Methodology
-----------

Theoretical (T) classes: Presentation of theoretical concepts and examples.

Theoretical-Practical (TP) classes: Support to parallel and concurrent program writing, as well as project support.

Paper + Presentations
---------------------

Deadline: 26th January 2020
Presentations: 27th January 2020, 14h (tentative)

Grading
---------

Final Grade = (0.4 * Paper * Presentation) + (0.3 * Assignments)

Paper:
	Students are expected to write a 8-page paper about a pre-approved topic. Papers are expected to be written
	individually or in groups of 2. The final paper grade will be proporcional to the evaluation of the presentation.
	The paper is due 2 days before the official exam date, and during the exam period, students will present their papers, followed by a discussion.
	
Assignments:
	4 assignments will be spread across the semester, and they are expected to be performed during TP and at home.
